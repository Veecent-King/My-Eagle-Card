        <!--  description -->
        <p>
          Eagles are generally larger and more powerful than hawks and may
          resemble a vulture in build and flight characteristics, but they have
          a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped with
          great curved talons. Most species subsist mainly on live prey, which
          they generally capture on the ground.
